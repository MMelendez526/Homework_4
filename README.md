Computational Physics Assignment #4

Problem #1 - Radioactive Decay.

 The problem asks to write a code that simulates the decay of an isotope to a more stable isotope through different methods. From this we are asked to plot out the number of isotopes as a function of time.  
 
 The graph is included in the repository and is titled 'Bi_Decay.eps'. 
 
Problem #2 - Monte Carlo Integration.

 This problem asks us to calculate the value of an integral using the importance of sampling formula. We are then asked to sample a certain number of random points and evaluate the integral, hoping to get a value around ~0.84. We are also asked to create a .txt file that shows the answer our code calculates. 
 
 When run, the code returns the following value: 0.838832686317
 
 The text file is included in the repository and is titled 'MonteCarlo.txt'.
